GAME DESCRIPTION HERE...

## Development

We coded 90% of the game via Live Share / pair programming. It was crucial for us to build the core functionality following a linear approach, as many of the game components work in parallel with each other. This was our first time working with the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) framework so we relied heavily on the framework documentation along with numerous tutorials and courses found online.
