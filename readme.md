# Labber's Fantasy Adventure
## Lighthouse Labs Final Project, powered by [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)

> Created by: [Tai Delisle](https://github.com/tai-de/) & [Edward Lee](https://github.com/edwardkinglee/)

You are **Labber**, a recent [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) graduate who, after 3 months of extensive study, have finally found some time to close your eyes and get some well-deserved sleep.

But just as you're about to drift off, you find yourself thrown into a fantasy world, full of monsters, traps, and other mysterious dangers.

Missing curly braces, recursion, and undefined variables don't sound too bad now, do they?

## Development

We coded 75-90% of the game via Live Share and pair programming. It was crucial for us to build the core functionality following a linear approach, as many of the game components work in parallel with each other. This was our first time working with the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) framework so we relied heavily on the framework documentation along with numerous tutorials and courses found online.

Once all of the base functionality had been implemented, we were able to further improve on different aspects of gameplay and design.
